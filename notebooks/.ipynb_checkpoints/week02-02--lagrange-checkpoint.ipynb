    "Let’s recall our television manufacturing example for a moment. The\n",
    "model we solved was interesting but most likely unrealistic. A\n",

    "produce a certain amount of TVs in total per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at an example where that capacity is 10,000 TVs per year.\n",

    "So given the *constraint*, $s + t ≤ 10,000$, how many of each model\n",
    "should they produce now??\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, first notice that the *unconstrained optimum* ofwith $s = 4,735$\n",
    "and $t = 7,043$, does not satisfy the constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s recall that in the single variable case, trying to find a\n",
    "*constrained optimum* amounts t optimizing a function on a closed\n",
    "interval – so you proceed with the usual procedure for optimization but\n",
    "must also check boundary points (endpoints).\n",
    "\n",
    "If we proceed in this fashion, we’d check the “boundary” conditions\n",
    "corresponding to $t=0$ and $s=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, setting $t=0$ we see that the profit function is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(s,0) = 144s - 0.01s^2 - 400,000.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is a function only of $s$ we can use 1-dimensional\n",
    "optimization techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dfrac{\\partial P}{\\partial S}(S,0) = 144 - 0.02s = 0 \\implies s = 7,200.$$\n",

    "On this boundary, we need to consider $(0,0)$ and $(10,000,0)$ (the\n",
    "boundary of the boundary…) as well as $(7,200,0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can treat the boundary with $s =0$ similarly.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the boundary condition with $s+t = 0$ will be more of a pain.\n",

    "The method of Lagrange multipliers gives a more systematic way to\n",
