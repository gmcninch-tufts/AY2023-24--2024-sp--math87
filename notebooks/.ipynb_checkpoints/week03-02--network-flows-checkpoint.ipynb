    "So far we have looked at a few examples of linear programs. The key step\n",
    "in modeling these problems is to write down the program itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw, for simple programs, such as the carpenter problem, we can\n",
    "figure it out geometrically. There were only a few variables and a few\n",
    "obvious constraints and it was easy to check all the “vertices.”\n",

    "Let’s try to formulate a linear program to minimize the costs.\n",

    "Let’s name the quantities from the table. - $t_i$ = expected \\# of\n",
    "tablecloths required on day $i$.\n",

    "        1 is equal to $f_1 + s_1$ and thus $b_1 - f_1 - s_1$ counts the\n",
    "        surplus from day 1. So we need\n",

    "        service on day 2, and those laundered via the slow service on\n",
