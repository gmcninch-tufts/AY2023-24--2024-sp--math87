    "    -   Here the question should be phrased correctly in mathematical\n",
    "        terms; this will help make clear what must be found.\n",
    "    -   Make a list of all the variables and constants; include units as\n",
    "        appropriate.\n",
    "    -   State all assumptions about these variables and constants;\n",
    "        include equations and inequalities.\n",
    "    -   Check units to make sure things make sense.\n",
    "    -   State your objective in mathematical terms (i.e., “minimization\n",
    "        problem” in the example above).\n",
    "    -   It may even be useful to make an educated guess at this point on\n",
    "        what the answer should be. <!-- -->\n",
    "2.  Select the modeling approach.\n",
    "    -   Choose a general solution procedure to solve the mathematical\n",
    "        problem (in our case first and second derivative tests).\n",
    "    -   This might be the most difficult part and to a large extent\n",
    "        depends on just good experience. That’s our goal…to get some\n",
    "        experience. <!-- -->\n",
    "3.  Formulate the model.\n",
    "    -   Restate the question in terms of your model (in our example,\n",
    "        what function are we taking the derivative of?).\n",
    "    -   You may need to relabel or redefine things to make it work. This\n",
    "        is where the mathematical model and real physical model may\n",
    "        start to differ… <!-- -->\n",

    "        but consider the errors that they may introduce. <!-- -->\n",

    "    -   Rephrase the result of Step 4 in non-technical terms.\n",
    "    -   Goal is now to make your answer understandable to the person\n",
    "        that posed it, keeping in mind that person may not be a\n",
    "        mathematician.\n",
    "    -   Think about what the errors might be, or how realistic the\n",
