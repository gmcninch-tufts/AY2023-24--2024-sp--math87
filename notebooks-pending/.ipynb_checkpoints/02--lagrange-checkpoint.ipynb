    "capacity and can only produce a certain amount of TVs in total per year. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at an example where that capacity is 10,000 TVs per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "So given the *constraint*, $s + t ≤ 10,000$, how many of each model should they produce now??\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, first notice that the *unconstrained optimum* with $s = 4,735$ and $t = 7,043$ -- found *previously* --\n",
    "does not satisfy the constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's recall that in the single variable case, trying to find a *constrained optimum* amounts to optimizing a function on a closed interval -- so you proceed with the usual procedure for optimization but must also check boundary points (endpoints).\n",
    "\n",
    "If we proceed in this fashion, we'd check the \"boundary\" conditions corresponding to $t=0$ and $s=0$.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$P(s,0) = 144s - 0.01s^2 - 400,000.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is a function only of $s$ we can use 1-dimensional optimization techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dfrac{\\partial P}{\\partial S}(S,0) = 144 - 0.02s = 0 \\implies s = 7200.$$\n",
