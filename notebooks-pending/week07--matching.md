Bi-partite graphs
=================

Let $G$ be an (undirected) graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$.

Suppose that we can divide the vertices into two disjoint collections --
i.e. suppose that we can represent $V$ as a *disjoint union*:

$$V = U \cup W.$$

Recall that an edge $e$ of $G$ connects two vertices: $e = [x,y]$ for
$x,y \in V$.  We say that $G$ is a *bi-partite* graph if for each edge
$e = [x,y]$, we have $x \in U$ and $y \in W$ (or vice versa). In
words, every edge connects a vertex in $U$ and a vertex in $W$.

Thus, we do not allow edges to connect a pair of vertices in $U$ or a
pair of vertices in $W$.

Matchings
=========

Let $G$ be a bi-partite graph, and suppose its vertex set $V$ is
written as a disjoint union $U \cup W$ as above.

A *matching* in $G$ is a set $M$ of edges in $E$ with the property that
no two edges in $M$ have a common vertex.

- A matching $M$ is *maximal* if $M \cup \{e\}$ is not a matching for
  any edge $e \not \in M$. 
  
  Thus $M$ is maximal if no larger set of edges is a matching.
  
- A matching $M$ has *maximum size* if there are no matchings $\tilde
  M$ in $G$ for which $|M| < |\tilde M|$ where $|X|$ denotes the
  *cardinality* of a set $X$ (i.e. $|X|$ denotes the number of
  elements in $X$, at least when $X$ is finite).
  
  Thus the matching $M$ has maximum size if there are no matchings
  with more edges.

- A matching is *perfect* if every vertex in $V$ is adjacent to one
  edge in the matching.

Hallâ€™s Marriage Theorem
=========================

Let $G$ be a bipartite graph with vertex set $V$ the disjoint union $U \cup W$. Suppose that
$|U| = |W|$ is finite.

For any set of nodes $X \subset U$, let us write $N(X) \subset W$ for the *neighborhood* of $X$, i.e.

$$N(X) = \{w \in W \mid w \, \text{is adjacent to a node in $X$}\}
= \{w \in W \mid \exists e=[u,w] \in E\, \text{for some $u \in X$}\}.$$

**Theorem:** A perfect matching exists if and only if for every subset $X$ of $U$, $|X| \le |N(X)|$.

In other words, if each set of nodes in $U$ has at least as many neighbors as its size, there is guaranteed to be a perfect matching.


<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region slideshow={"slide_type": "subslide"} -->
**Remark:** Here is a way to visualize the statement of the theorem. Consider a group of $n$ companies who are interested in hiring from a group of $n$ recent college graduates. These $2n$ entities form the vertices of a graph. All graduates will take any job, but certain companies will only hire certain graduates -- the conditions "company x will hire graduate y" determine the edges of the graph, which is bi-partite. In this setting, a perfect matching represents an hiring outcome where each graduate gets a job and each company gets an employee. 

The Theorem says that if for each $m \le n$, each collection of $m$ companies is willing to hire at least $m$ of the graduates, a perfect matching can be achieved.

You can read more about [the theorem here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall%27s_marriage_theorem).

Proof of the Theorem
====================

The Theorem asserts that two statements are logically equivalent - we must prove an "if and only if" statement; such statements are sometimes written symbolically using $\iff$. To prove the Theorem, we must prove that the first statement implies the second, and then that the second statement implies the first.

To do this, we first suppose that $G$ has a perfect matching (that is the first statement). We must argue that an arbitrary set of vertices satisfies the condition in the second statement. In other words, we prove the assertion $\implies$.

Let us write $M$ for a perfect matching for the graph $G$, and let $X$ be an arbitrary set of vertices in $G$.

Since $M$ is a perfect matching, for each vertex $x \in X$, there is exactly one edge $[x,v_x] \in M$ involving $x$. Moreover, $x \neq y \implies v_x \neq v_y$. Since $v_x \in N(X)$ for each $x \in X$, it is now clear that $|N(X)| \ge |X|$. We have now proved that the assertion $\implies$ is valid.
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region slideshow={"slide_type": "subslide"} -->

To complete the proof of the Theorem, we must now prove $\Longleftarrow$.

Thus, we suppose that $G$ satifies the condition $|N(X)| \ge |X|$ for each set of nodes $X$, and we must prove that there is a perfect matching.

Here we use the *principle of mathematical induction*.

- **base case:** 

  Suppose that $|U| = |V| = 1$. For any bipartite graph $G$ with this  property, there must be either 1 or 0 edges. Now, the assumption that $|N(X)| \ge |X|$ for any $X$ means in particular that
$|N(U)| \ge 1$ which means that the neighborhood of the vertex in $U$ is not empty -- thus, there is at least one (and hence exactly one) edge $e$ connecting the vertex in $U$ to some vertex. It is now easy to see that $M = \{e\}$ is a perfect pairing.



<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region slideshow={"slide_type": "subslide"} -->

- **inductive hypothesis:**

  We now assume the following:
  
  whenever we are given a bi-partite graph $H$ with nodes $U_k \cup W_k$ and $|U_k| = |W_k| = k < n$, then we know the Theorem holds.
  
We must now prove the result when $|U| = |W| = n$.

Note that one of the following two possibilties must hold:

1. for every number $k$ satisfying $0 < k < n$, every set $X_k$ of $k$-vertices in $U$ satisfies $|N(X_k)| > k$.
2. for some $k$, $0 < k < n$, there is a set $X_k$ of vertices in $U$ for which $N(X_k) = k$.

<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region slideshow={"slide_type": "subslide"} -->
Let's first consider case 1. Thus we suppose:

- for every number $k$ satisfying $0 < k < n$, every set $X_k$ of $k$-vertices in $U$ satisfies $|N(X_k)| > k$.

In this case, choose a vertex $x \in U$ and consider the subset $U' = U \setminus \{x\}$ of $U$.

Now, our assumption shows in particular that $x$ has at least one match in $W$; let's choose one and call that match $y$. Thus $[x,y]$ is an edge.

Now form $W' = W \setminus \{y\}$, and 
consider the *subgraph* $G'$ determined by the $U' \cup W'$.
The edges of the graph $G'$ are precisely the edges of $G$ not involving either $x$ or $y$.

Computing neighborhoods in $G$, our assumption means that any subset $X$ of $U'$ satisfies $|N_G(X)| > |X|$. Computing the neighborhood in $G'$ we can't lose more than one neighbor -- thus $|N_{G'}(X)| \ge |N_G(X)| - 1 \ge |X|$. 

This shows that the inductive hypothesis applies to the graph $G'$; thus $G'$ has a perfect matching $M'$, and it is easy to see that
$M = M' \cup \{[x,y]\}$ is then a perfect matching for $G$.
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region slideshow={"slide_type": "subslide"} -->
Now consider case 2. Thus we suppose:

- for some $k$, $0 < k < n$, there is a set $X_k$ of vertices in $U$ for which $N(X_k) = k$.

Taking $U' = X_k$ and $W' = N(X_k)$, we find a graph $G'$ having $2k$ vertices and satisfying the conditions of the inductive hypothesis. Thus, there is a perfect matching $M'$ for the graph $G'$.

Now consider the remaining $n-k$ vertices $U'' = U \setminus U'$ in $U$, and the remaining
$n-k$ vertices $W'' = W \setminus W'$ in $W$, and form the resulting graph $G''$.

We want to argue that the inductive hypothesis holds also for $G''$. Well,
if $X$ is a subset of $U''$ with $|X| = \ell$, then from the point of view of $G$,
$U' \cup X$ is a set of $k + \ell$ vertices.

The original assumption means that $N(U' \cup X)$ has at least $k+\ell$ vertices.
Notice that $N(U'\cup X) = N(U') \cup N(X)$. Since $|N(U')| = k$, it must be the case that
$N(X)$ has at least $\ell$ not contained in $N(U')$. This indeed shows that the graph $G''$ satisfies the inductive hypothesis and hence there is a perfect matching $M''$ for $G''$.

<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region slideshow={"slide_type": "subslide"} -->

Now $M = M' \cup M''$ is a perfect matching for the original graph $G$.

The Theorem now follows by induction.

Applying Hall's Theorem
=======================

Notice that what is proved in Hall's Theorem is an *existence statement*. If we have a bi-partite graph satisfying the indicated condition, we now know that that graph has a perfect matching. But the Theorem tells us nothing about how we might *find* a perfect matching.

One way to try to find a matching is to interpret as a ``max-flow`` problem.

A new graph
-----------

Given an undirected bipartite graph $G$, and we will form a new graph $G'$ which is directed, weighted, and has one source and one terminal node.

In fact, we write $V = U \cup W$ for the vertices in $G$ as usual, and we construct the
vertex set of $G'$ as:

$$V' = V \cup \{s,t\}$$

for *new* symbols $s,t$.

Now, we require that $G'$ has a directed edge $s \to u$ for each $u \in U$, with capacity $c(s \to u) = 1$.

And we require that $G'$ has a directed edge $w \to t$ for each $w \in W$, with capacity
$c(w \to t) = 1$.

Finally, we view each edge $[u,w]$ in $G$ as a directed edge $u \to w$ in the graph $G'$
with capacity $c(u \to w) = 1$.
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region slideshow={"slide_type": "subslide"} -->
Interpretation of matching via max-flow
---------------------------------------

Consider the bipartite graph $G$ as before, and let $G'$ be the directed graph we have associated to it.


Theorem
-------

a. The ``max-flow`` of $G'$ is an integer, and is achieved by a flow $f$ with $f(e) \in \mathbb{Z}$ for each edge $e$ of $G'$.

b. If $G$ has a matching of size $k$, then ``max-flow`` $\ge k$.

c. If the ``max-flow`` is equal to $k$, the largest matching in $G$ involves $k$ edges.


**Proof:**

The ingegrality assertion in a) follows because $G'$ defines a "totally unimodular" linear program -- see previous notebook discussion!


<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region slideshow={"slide_type": "subslide"} -->
For b), let $M$ be a matching of size $k$ for $G$. Consider the following assignment on the graph $G'$:

- if $[u,w]$ is in the matching $M$ for $u \in U$ and $w \in W$, set $f(s \to u) = f(u \to w) = f(w \to t) = 1$.

- set $f(e) = 0$ for all other edges in $G'$.

One readily sees that $f$ satisfies the requirements to be a flow. Moreover, by definition $|f| = k$, and hence ``max-flow`` $\ge k$.

<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region slideshow={"slide_type": "subslide"} -->
Finally, for c), suppose that ``max-flow`` is equal to $k$, and let $f$ be a flow
with $|f| = k$. Write $\ell = $ length of the largest matching in $G$.

Let $X$ be the set of nodes in $U$ for which there is an edge $e$ with $e=[u,w]$, $u \in U$ and $f(e) \neq 0$.

The conservation laws guarantee that $M = \{e = [u,w] \mid u \in X, f(e) \neq 0\}$ defines a matching. Since $k = |M|$, it follows that $\ell \ge k$. On the other hand, b) shows that $\ell \le k$ hence equality holds.

Model Reduction
===============

A general strategy in mathematical modeling is to replace one problem with another equivalent problem; this is known as *model reduction*.

In the present case, we can replace the problem "find the maximum matching" by a ``max-flow`` problem. We can use ``linprog`` to solve the ``max-flow`` problem. 

The ``max-flow`` value will indicate the size of a maximum matching.
If the solver gives an optimal flow with values 0 and 1, we can read off a maximum matching.

Example
--------

In the cell below, there is some code for finding the matching in a bipartite graph.

The graph should be defined by giving two lists ``U`` and ``W`` together
with a list of edges ``edges`` whose members should be tuples ``(u,w)`` with ``u`` in ``U`` and ``w`` in ``W``.

The code builds an equality constraint matrix determined by the conservation laws for the directed graph associated as above with the directed graph.

This code is used on some *randomly generated* bipartites graphs, which are constructed as follows:

```
from numpy.random import default_rng

rng = default_rng()

U = ["Alice","Bob","Cathy","Doug","Ellen","Frank"]
W = ["task 1","task 2","task 3","task 4","task 5","task 6"]

prob = .3

edges=[(x,y) for (x,y) in product(U,W) if rng.random()<prob]
```

(There is also some code for producing representations of the graphs).
