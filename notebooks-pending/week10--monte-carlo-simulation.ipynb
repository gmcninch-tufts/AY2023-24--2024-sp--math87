    "Fish Tank Emporium** (JFTE).\n",
    "\n",
    "JFTE sells only 150 gallon fish tanks that are bulky, so it prefers to\n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose that on average JFTE sells one tank per week.\n",
    "\n",
    "JFTE can order new tanks at any point, but they must wait 5 days for the\n",
    "arrival of a new tank once it has been ordered.\n",

    "-   profit from the sale of a tank?\n",
    "-   cost of storage for an unsold tank in stock?\n",
    "-   what does “on average, one tank is sold per week” really mean??\n",
    "-   what strategies are even possible?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s consider some extremal cases first:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   if the profit per tank is large and the storage costs for an\n",
    "    in-stock tank relatively small, then a good strategy is to keep a\n",
    "    relatively large inventory.\n",
    "-   if the profit per tank is small and the storage costs for an\n",
    "    in-stock tank are relatively large, then a good strategy is to keep\n",
    "    little-or-no inventory and order as required.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is difficult to formulate too many generalities without knowing\n",
    "further information.\n",

    "# Simplifying assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Let’s assume that “on average, JFTE sells one tank per week” means\n",
    "    that on any given day, there is a $\\dfrac{1}{7}$ chance of an\n",
    "    interested customer entering the store.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  If an interested customer arrives but there is no stock, the\n",
    "    potential sale is then *lost* (thus our model doesn’t acknowledge\n",
    "    rainchecks or instructions to a customer to “try next week”).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  The cost of storing a tank is high enough that you only want to\n",
    "    store tanks you expect to sell “soon”.\n",
    "\n",
    "These assumptions suggest two strategies, which we want to compare.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy A.** Set a *standing order* to have one tank delivered each\n",
    "week.  \n",
    "**Strategy B.** Order a new tank whenever one is sold – *on-demand\n",
    "ordering*\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use a Monte-Carlo simulation to compare these two\n",
    "strategies. <!-- #endregion -->\n",

    "# Our simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to simulate arrival of customers. We are going to make\n",
    "a list of $N$ days for our simulation, and for each day we are going to\n",
    "use a random selection to “decide” whether a customer arrives.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each day, we would like to keep track of various information:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   does a customer arrive? (determined randomly)\n",
    "-   is there a tank in stock? (ordering is determined by our strategy)\n",
    "\n",
    "So let’s create a `python` data structure which keeps track of the\n",
    "required information. We’ll just use a `class` named `JFTE` which has\n",
    "instance variables `customers`, `stock`, `sales` etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we construct an instance of the class, we indicate the number of\n",
    "days `N` for our simulation. We create a list corresponding to `days`,\n",
    "and the random number generated “decides” whether or not a customer will\n",
    "arrive on the given day.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now implement our *strategies* as functions which take as argument an\n",
    "instance of the class `JFTE` and return an instance of the class\n",
