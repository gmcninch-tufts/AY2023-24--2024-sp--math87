Mathematical Modeling - Math087 - Spring 2024
--------------------------------------------

Schedule & Format
------------------------------

- **Professor: **[George McNinch](http://gmcninch.math.tufts.edu)
  <<george.mcninch@tufts.edu>>


The class will be *virtual* and will be run in a [flipped style] --
see details below: [here](#grading-and-expect) and
[here](#resources). Course content will be presented *asynchronously*
as *reading material* together with recorded videos
accompanying/commenting on the material . These materials will be
posted regularly on the [course web site] throughout the term.


Here is a table of regularly scheduled events:

Table: **Weekly Schedule**

|                |         |         Mon |         Wed |        Thur |         Fri |   Sun |
|----------------|---------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Zoom           | McNinch | 09:00-10:15 | 09:00-10:15 |             |             |       |
| Zoom           | Hoover  |             |             |             | 13:30-14:30 |       |
| consult        | McNinch |             | 15:00-16:00 | 15:00-16:00 |             |       |
| assignment due |         |             |             |             |             | 24:00 |

(*) this time may change.

-----

**Problem Sessions**: Each week there will be *three problem sessions*;
these will take place "*live*" on
[zoom](https://www.zoom.com). Invitations to the zoom sessions should
be found on the course ``Canvas`` site.

The problem session will involve discussion of and directed work on
problems similar to those in the course materials and in the course
homework. These problems will typically be distributed as "handout
problems" (and posted on the course website), but won't be collected.

The problem sessions will also provide time for questions and
discussion about course materials more generally, and for specific
questions about the course assignments.

The problem sessions on Monday and Wednesday will be run by McNinch,
and will be (at least roughly) identical -- the idea is that you should
only attend one of these sessions.  The session on Thursday will be
hosted by the course TA, and is intended to be more "office-hour
like". Attend this session as needed or desired.

Note that if a student is unable to attend either the Mon or Wed
sessions (say, because they are remote and on the West Coast), the
Thursday session gives partial accommodation for this situation by
providing an opportunity for follow-up on the "handout problems".


I've included some [guidelines about zoom use
here.](/course-info/03a-resources--zoom.html)


**Consult times:** I have scheduled a few time blocks with the label
"*consult*" - these are intended to be times when you can schedule a
one-on-one meeting with me.  Please don't treat these times as
*drop-in* though; I ask that you contact me (e.g. by email) to let me
know in advance that you'd like to meet. If these times don't work for
you we can try to find some mutually workable time.

Course Grading & Expectations   {#grading-and-expect}
--------------------------------

*You should keep up with the posted material throughout the  course!!*

There will be *weekly problem sets*, two *midterm reports*, and a
*final report*. These will be collected at ``24:00`` (i.e. ``12:00
midnight``) on Sundays. You should expect to hand in **one** assignment each
Sunday (**two** including your *engagement* submission; see below);
during weeks in which there is midterm or final report due, there
won't be a problem set assigned.


- There is no required textbook for the course.

- During the term, I will collect and mark 10 problem sets, 2 midterm
  course reports, and 1 final report.

Together with your *engagment score* your marks on these assignments
will determine your score (and thus your grade) in the course, as
indicated in this table:


Table: **Grading**

| grade component | # of marks     | score (points) | total points   |
| :-----------    | :---------     | :------------  | :-----------   |
| problem sets    | 10             | 50 each        | 450 (drop one) |
| reports         | 3              | 100 each       | 300            |
| engagement      | 1 (cumulative) | 75 (total)     | 75             |

-------

In summary, you will earn a score of up to 825 possible points. I will
use that score to determine and assign **letter grades**.
       
The **engagement** score is intended to encourage participation in the
weekly problem sets.  Each week (excepting weeks in which a midterm
report is due) you will submit a brief written document to
``gradescope`` -- typically, a response to a prompt made in the
problem sessions -- and these submissions will determine your
cumulative engagement score.

As indicated, I will drop one homework mark.  Late problem sets and
reports will be accepted, with a 20% point reduction for each day that
assignment is late. Of course, if there are extenuating circumstances
*let me know* and I will make an assessment.

There is a document on the course web site spelling out expectations
and rubrics for course work.

<!-- Misha's "considerations" -->
<!-- Considerations:  It is impossible to envision all possible scenarios in which students might find themselves during the fall semester. The attendance requirement at 75 % is intended to mitigate the potential impact of such situations as short term illness or disruption due to travel or quarantine, as is the policy of dropping the lowest homework score. Moreover, it is intended that the lectures will be recorded and available so that students who find themselves in different time zones, quarantined (but not otherwise ill), or change student status to “remote” learning will still be able to keep up with the material. Extensions to the two take-home exams will be given if warranted by extraordinary circumstances. Additionally, there will be some flexibility in scheduling the verbal examination component of the two exams. -->

<!-- Notify the instructor immediately if: -->

<!-- •you are currently in, or transition to, a time zone that would preclude attending at least 75 % of the zoom lectures or impact scheduling the verbal component of the 2 exams. -->
<!-- •you find yourself in a situation where remote real-time attendance is possible, but real-time participation is not. -->

<!-- Lectures are being recorded, but the homework and exams should be submitted by the indicated date and time (Eastern), unless otherwise pre-arranged with the instructor. -->

Course resources {#resources}
----------------

Important links for our course include:

-  [canvas.tufts.edu] (the course's canvas site)
-  [gradescope] (you'll submit work here for grading)

Enrollment in the course should automagically enroll you in the
course's site on canvas. I'll use the canvas site for posting course
announcements, announcing the ``zoom`` session times, and posting
scores & grades.

[canvas.tufts.edu]: http://canvas.tufts.edu
[gradescope]: http://www.gradescope.com
<!-- [piazza]: http://piazza.com/tufts/fall2020/math0087 -->
[course-page]: https://gmcninch-tufts.github.io/tufts-math87-fall2020/

The written content for the course will be distributed in the form of
[jupyter notebooks]. You can interact with these notebooks either by
installing the requisite (open source) software on your computer, or
using [Google's colab] (or both, of course...). The course web site
has links to further discussion of:

- python & jupyter (including installation instructions, if desired)
- gradescope usage notes for our course
   
[jupyter notebooks]: https://jupyter.org/

Problem sets and the midterm & final reports will be collected on
[gradescope]. So you must submit a ``PDF`` document of your homework
solutions. I encourage you to learn enough ``LaTeX`` to typeset your
homework solutions; the course web site has some suggestions that
should help you get started.

Students are encouraged to regularly visit the Discussions forum for
the course on ``Canvas``.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

This course intends to train students in their understanding of higher
mathematics, as described in the [Math department's learning
objectives](https://ase.tufts.edu/faculty/committees/objectives/math.htm)

In particular, the course should:

-  contribute to a basic understanding of higher mathematics, by:
   - providing a working understanding of basic insights
     and methods, and 
   - demonstrating the use of mathematics to think about problems
     outside of mathematics;
- contribute to facility with written communication of mathematics; and
- contribute to literacy in *scientific computing*.
