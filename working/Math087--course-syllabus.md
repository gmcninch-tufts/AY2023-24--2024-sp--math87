# Course Grading & Expectations   {#grading-and-expect}


*You should keep up with the posted material throughout the  course!!*


Your grade in the course will be based on  *problem sets*,
*engagement*, two *midterm reports* and a *final report*.

Here are details on these course components:

- *weekly problem sets*, 

  Since the class meets on Mondays and Wednesdays, problem sets will
  be collected weekly on *Fridays* (some weeks, a midterm report --
  see below -- will instead by collected on Friday). [Here is the
  planned collection
  schedule](/course-pages/Math087--Assignments--AY2023-2024spring.html).

  A total of 10 problem sets will be collected.

  The problems will be posted on the course website, and your
  solutions will be submitted to [Gradescope] -- see [these remarks
  concerning use of
  gradescope](/course-posts/resources--gradescope.html).

- *engagement*

  Each week (beginning in the second week) I'll ask you to make a
  written submission *on paper*.  I'll provide a prompt *in advance*,
  and you should write a paragraph or two in response and return it in
  class.

- 2 *midterm reports*

- 1 *final report*

  Note that you will submit a *proposal* for the final report prior to work.

Please refer to the [rubric and
expectation](/course-posts/resources--expectations-and-rubrics.html) for further
remarks concerning these course components.

Your score in the course will be determined from these grading components by the
following (implicit) formula:

Table: **Grading**

| grade component  |   percentage |
| :-----------     | :----------- |
| problem sets     |          50% |
| engagement       |          10% |
| midterm report 1 |          10% |
| midterm report 2 |          10% |
| final report     |          20% |

-------

Your *letter grade* is then determined from this score using [the
scheme described at this
link](https://math.tufts.edu/resources/grading-schemes).
