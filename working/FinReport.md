# Report

*due [2024-04-26 Friday]*

Your report should be submitted as a *PDF* on *gradescope*.

Your research is *not expected to be original or novel*. However, it
is expected that you will do a review of the literature on the
problem, discussing what has been done by others (clearly citing that
work) and presenting some analysis of your study.

Submission of your paper warrants that it is written in your own
words, and that you have not copied from any source without direct
citation.

Your report should include the following:

-  A brief abstract summarizing the results of your project.
-  Clear statement of the *problem* and your *modeling goals*,
   including what aspect you have studied.
-  Explanation of *assumptions* and a *rationale or justification* for
   how they bear on the problem.
-  Description of your model and justification for the choice modeling
   choices.
-  Description of model testing, sensitivity analysis, or computation
   used, including error analysis.
-  Discussion of strengths and weaknesses of your model or approach.
-  Give a Literature Review by citing a few references of current or
   past research on the subject.
-  Discussion of applications to which this problem would be
   applicable, or why the analysis you chose provides insight into the
   specific research area.

# Video Presentation

*due [2024-04-26 Friday]*

> Your video presentation will be uploaded to *tufts.box.com*, but I
> haven't yet set up the necessary folder.

You will make a video recording of a 10 minute presentation
summarizing the analysis you have done in your report. While the
presentation does not have to be as detailed or as technical as your
paper, it should give your audience a clear idea of what you have done
and what you have found.

The video can be you writing on a white board, or you can create
slides which you display in the video while speaking.
